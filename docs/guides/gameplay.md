# Gameplay

## Main

A normal game will have 4 phases after matchmaking.

- Talking
  - Players can talk about what happened in the previous node or about other stuff before entering the voting phase
  - This phase is twice as long during the first round in order to allow players to get settled in
  - Players can choose to skip this phase, with a specific percentage needed to actually skip
  - Players can vote to pause the game during this phase, with the vote going through depending on the percentage agreed upon
    - The game is resumed if the threshold for skipping is met during the pause

- Voting
  - Players take their time to vote on each others proposals, with proposals going counter clockwise from the last proposer
    - The proposer for the next round is the one next after the accepted proposal for the round

- Server Maintenance

- Aftermath
