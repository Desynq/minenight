## Agents

As the cybersecurity technicians of your typical dystopian business, Agents are required to maintain security within their servers and prevent any unwanted intruders (hackers) from compromising the majority of them (3 out of 5 servers).

The winning condition of agents is to prevent the hackers from taking over the majority of the servers (Get 3 servers secured). Agents may still lose afterwards if their admin's account is successfully infiltrated by the INFILTRATOR.

Agents do not know who each other is nor do they know their admin. If enabled, they can know their interns.

### Admin

The admin is in charge of maintaining ultimate security within the business as they have direct access to their server logs. This means that the admin knows who the hackers are among the supposed agents. The admin, however, must protect his identity as, if revealed to the infiltrator, will compromise all the servers at the end of the game even if agents secure enough servers to win.

### Interns

Interns are basically unpaid journeyman technicians who are given the promise of a possible future career path. They are by default known by all agents except for interns themselves.

The amount of interns in a game is determined by a rule and can vary from 0 to all agents except for the admin.
