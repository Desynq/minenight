# Interns

Internment has some agents turned into interns.
Some hackers, optionally, are also turned into false interns.

Interns are known by all agents, and optionally, by all hackers (scripties may, optionally, not know).
False interns follow the same visibility as interns but may optionally be visible to their hacker teammates (scripties may, optionally, not know).

The goal of the interns is to act as a solid vote, while false interns, if included, can obfuscate this, potentially ruining the whole game if the true intern is not revealed fast enough.
